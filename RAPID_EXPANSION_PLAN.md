## ‚ö° CLAUDE MULTI-PROMPT DEPLOYMENT CHAIN

### **PROMPT 1: TLD Contract Generator**
```
You are my Solidity architect. Generate complete ERC-721 TLD contracts for these high-value domains:
.gold, .oil, .usd, .real, .bank

Each contract must:
1. Inherit from DigitalGiantRegistry pattern
2. Include soulbound root token (ID 0) 
3. ERC-6551 vault binding for each subdomain
4. IPFS metadata integration
5. ISO 20022 compliance events
6. Sector-specific metadata fields
7. Admin address: 0x8aced25DC8530FDaf0f86D53a0A1E02AAfA7Ac7A

Create 5 separate .sol files with proper naming convention.
```

### **PROMPT 2: Mass Deployment Script**
```
Create a Hardhat deployment script that:
1. Deploys all 5 TLD contracts to Polygon in sequence
2. Sets up proper constructor parameters
3. Mints root token (ID 0) for each TLD
4. Uploads genesis certificates to IPFS
5. Logs all contract addresses and transaction hashes
6. Generates deployment report with Polygonscan links
7. Updates environment variables automatically

Make it error-resistant with proper gas estimation and retry logic.
```

### **PROMPT 3: Subdomain Factory System**
```
Build a SubdomainFactory contract that can:
1. Mint subdomains across all TLD contracts
2. Auto-create ERC-6551 vault for each subdomain
3. Handle batch minting for enterprise clients
4. Implement pricing tiers by TLD (.bank = premium, .vault = standard)
5. Revenue sharing between registry and TLD owners
6. Compliance hooks for corporate verification

Include management functions for batch operations.
```

### **PROMPT 4: Frontend Portal Expansion**
```
Extend the Next.js portal with:
1. TLD selection dropdown with all available domains
2. Sector-specific minting interfaces (different forms for .bank vs .gold)
3. Bulk subdomain management for enterprises
4. Vault dashboard showing all ERC-6551 accounts
5. Compliance document upload by sector
6. Revenue analytics for domain owners
7. Marketplace for secondary domain sales

Use the existing RainbowKit/Wagmi setup and maintain consistent branding.
```

### **PROMPT 5: Enterprise Integration APIs**
```
Create REST API endpoints for:
1. Domain availability checking across all TLDs
2. Bulk domain registration for enterprises
3. Compliance verification status
4. Vault balance and transaction history
5. Corporate document management
6. KYC/AML integration hooks
7. Webhook notifications for domain events

Build with Next.js API routes and proper authentication.
```

## üí∞ IMMEDIATE MONETIZATION STRATEGY

### **Launch Pricing Structure**
| Domain Type | Base Price | Renewal | Vault Setup | Target Market |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **.gold premium** | $10,000 | $1,000/yr | $500 | Bullion dealers |
| **.oil premium** | $25,000 | $2,500/yr | $1,000 | Energy majors |
| **.bank premium** | $50,000 | $5,000/yr | $2,000 | Financial institutions |
| **.real premium** | $15,000 | $1,500/yr | $750 | Real estate developers |
| **.usd premium** | $20,000 | $2,000/yr | $1,000 | DeFi/Forex traders |

**Revenue Projection (Month 1)**:
- 20 premium domains √ó $15K average = $300K
- 100 standard subdomains √ó $500 = $50K  
- 50 vault setups √ó $750 = $37.5K
- **Total Month 1**: ~$387.5K

### **Enterprise Package Deals**
1. **Banking Suite**: .bank domain + 10 subdomains + compliance integration = $75K
2. **Real Estate Portfolio**: .real domain + 25 property subdomains + RWA hooks = $100K  
3. **Energy Conglomerate**: .oil domain + trading subdomains + commodity links = $125K
4. **Investment Fund**: .gold domain + vault integration + fractional ownership = $85K

```
I need you to create 5 complete Solidity TLD contracts for my Digital Giant registry:
.gold, .oil, .usd, .real, .bank

Use this pattern as base:
[Copy your DigitalGiantRegistry.sol here]

Each TLD should:
- Be sector-specific (add relevant metadata fields)
- Include premium pricing tiers  
- Have compliance hooks for that industry
- Auto-generate ERC-6551 vaults
- Be deployment-ready for Polygon

Create separate files: GoldTLD.sol, OilTLD.sol, UsdTLD.sol, RealTLD.sol, BankTLD.sol
```

### **üî• PROMPT PACKAGE B: DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM**
```
Create a complete Hardhat deployment script that:
1. Deploys all 5 TLD contracts in sequence
2. Handles gas optimization and error recovery
3. Updates .env with all new addresses  
4. Generates IPFS metadata for each TLD
5. Creates deployment report with Polygonscan links
6. Sets up proper admin permissions

Use my existing setup:
- Admin: 0x8aced25DC8530FDaf0f86D53a0A1E02AAfA7Ac7A
- Network: Polygon mainnet
- Pattern: DigitalGiantRegistry style
```

### **üî• PROMPT PACKAGE C: FRONTEND EXPANSION**
